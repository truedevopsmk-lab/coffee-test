A layered and evolving cup. The acidity feels refined rather than sharp, and sweetness becomes more expressive as the temperature drops.

## 📝 Journal Thoughts

The dry aroma was immediately vibrant and floral — energizing even before brewing.

Using the 4:6 method structured the cup beautifully. Florals dominated early while hot, elegant and expressive. As it cooled — my favorite phase — the plum sweetness deepened and the body turned softly tea-like.

Further down the temperature curve, the wine-like character emerged with nuance and gentle tanginess. The 4:6 method mellowed the acidity nicely, keeping it refined rather than aggressive.

North East Indian coffees continue to surprise me — expressive, unique, and full of character.
