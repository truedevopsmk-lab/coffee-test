## Tasting Notes (Guided Tasting)

### Aroma
- **Dry grounds**: Sweet fermented fruit, wine-gummy notes  
- **Wet bloom**: Strong tropical fruit — passionfruit & pineapple

### Taste Progression
- **Hot**: Juicy mosambi-like acidity, soft and rounded  
- **Mid-palate**: Pineapple candy sweetness, syrupy body  
- **As it cools**: Passionfruit becomes clearer, sweetness increases  
- **Finish**: Clean black-tea dryness, pleasant fruit-skin bitterness

### Aftertaste
- Lingering tea-like finish with gentle tropical sweetness  
- No harsh bitterness, very clean cup

---

## Overall Impression
This coffee rewards **patience and temperature awareness**.  
Most of the magic happens as the cup cools — sweetness intensifies, acidity softens, and the black tea note ties everything together.

Anaerobic character is present but controlled, not overpowering.  
Best enjoyed slowly, with intentional tasting rather than casual sipping.

## Tweaks for Next Brew
- Try **1 click coarser** to soften acidity further  
- Experiment with **slightly longer bloom (50s)** for more fruit sweetness  
- Compare with a **Hoffmann-style single-pour** for clarity vs sweetness
