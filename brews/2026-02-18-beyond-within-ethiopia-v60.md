## 👅 Cup Profile & Notes

* **Aroma:** Soft florals with light citrus lift.
* **Taste:** Tea-like clarity with lemongrass brightness and mild toffee sweetness.
* **Acidity:** Gentle, citrus-leaning, not sharp.
* **Body:** Light to medium-light, structured like oolong tea.
* **Finish:** Clean initially; fades slightly as it cools.

The cup opened with delicate florals and a subtle citrus edge. As it cooled, the tea-like character became more pronounced, but sweetness plateaued, and the finish softened faster than expected.

## 🔧 Adjustment Notes

* Try slightly finer grind to improve sweetness development.
* Increase water temperature to 90–91°C for better extraction.
* Add slightly more agitation on second pour to enhance body.

## 📝 Journal Thoughts

This brew expressed the Ethiopian natural character in a restrained and elegant way. It leaned more toward tea structure than fruit-forward intensity, which made it pleasant but not explosive.

The sweetness was moderate and present, though I felt it could have been pushed further with minor extraction tweaks. The finish was clean while hot but tapered as it cooled.

Overall, a composed and balanced cup that rewards attentive brewing rather than aggressive extraction.
