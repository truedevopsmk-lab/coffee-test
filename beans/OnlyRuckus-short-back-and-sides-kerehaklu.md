### Extra Context
This coffee is part of Ruckus Coffee’s recurring **OnlyRuckus** nano-lot releases sourced from **Kerehaklu Estate** in India’s Cauvery region.

The label indicates a **cultured process**, a fermentation-driven approach commonly used to introduce controlled flavor development while maintaining clarity. Coffees from Kerehaklu Estate are well known within the Indian specialty community for their progressive processing experiments and for showcasing non-traditional varietals such as Obata, Kerebica, and Sarchimor alongside Catimor.
