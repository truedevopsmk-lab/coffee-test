### Extra Context
This coffee is sourced from **Lithanro Partner Farms** in Wokha, Nagaland, a region in Northeast India that has been gaining recognition for producing distinctive, high-elevation Arabica coffees. The listed altitude of 1400 m supports slower cherry maturation, which is commonly associated with increased complexity and acidity.

The coffee is processed using a **honey sundried method**, indicating partial mucilage retention during drying, which typically enhances sweetness and body while maintaining clarity. The varietal is listed as **SL 9/15**, a selection associated with structured acidity and cup clarity. Hill Groove Coffee Roasters, based in Dehradun, focuses on small-batch roasting with an emphasis on light profiles suited for manual brewing.

### Brew History

- 2026-02-17 — V60 (4:6 Method): Tad bit of acidity, Wine like, plum sweetness, clean oolong-tea finish

### Personal Notes

The beans felt incredibly pleasant the moment I opened the bag — the dry aroma alone was enough to wake me up. It was vibrant, floral, and inviting even before brewing.

I extracted this as a V60 pourover using the 4:6 method. During the brew and in the first few hot sips, the floral notes clearly dominated — bright, expressive, and elegant. As it began to cool (which is always my favorite part, sipping through the full spectrum), the cup gradually turned sweeter with a soft, oolong-tea-like body. The texture felt light yet structured.

Further down the temperature curve, it transformed beautifully into a wine-like profile — nuanced, slightly tangy, and layered, exactly the kind of finish I personally enjoy the most. The 4:6 method seemed to mellow the acidity nicely, keeping it controlled and refined rather than sharp.

Overall, this was a very enjoyable experience. Coffees from the North East of India never fail to surprise me — expressive, unique, and full of character.
