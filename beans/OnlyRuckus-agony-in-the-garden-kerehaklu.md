### Extra Context
This coffee is part of Ruckus Coffee’s **OnlyRuckus** nano-lot series and is titled **“Agony in the Garden.”** It is a small, preorder-based release sourced from **Kerehaklu Estate** in India’s Cauvery region. The listing explicitly notes this as the **first release of the Kerebica variety**, described as an experimental graft varietal.

The coffee is roasted specifically for filter brewing and processed using a **cultured fermentation**, indicating a controlled, fermentation-forward approach designed to enhance clarity and structure. Within the Indian specialty community, Kerehaklu Estate is widely regarded for its progressive experimentation with varietals and processing, and nano-lots like this are typically appreciated as exploratory coffees showcasing distinct varietal character rather than consistency across releases.
