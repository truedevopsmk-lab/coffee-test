### Extra Context
ONA Coffee is known for competition-level roasting with a strong emphasis on balance, sweetness, and clarity in filter profiles. Their approach typically favors clean washed coffees that perform consistently across pour-over methods.

La Huerta is a Honduran farm producing coffee at relatively high altitude, contributing to structured acidity and slower cherry maturation. The Catimor variety, while often associated with resilience and yield, can express pleasant sweetness and approachability when grown at elevation and carefully processed.

This coffee is well suited for daily filter brewing where balance and sweetness are prioritized over intensity.
