### Extra Context

ONA Coffee is known for competition-level roasting with a strong emphasis on balance, sweetness, and clarity in filter profiles. Their approach typically favors clean washed coffees that perform consistently across pour-over methods.

La Huerta is a Honduran farm producing coffees at relatively high altitude, which contributes to structured acidity and slower cherry maturation. The **Catimor** variety, while often associated with higher yield and resilience, can produce pleasantly sweet and approachable cups when grown at elevation and carefully processed. In washed form, Catimor lots like this are commonly appreciated for **caramelized sweetness, gentle fruit character, and an easy-drinking profile** rather than overt florals or sharp acidity.

This coffee is well suited for daily filter brewing where balance and sweetness are prioritized over intensity.
