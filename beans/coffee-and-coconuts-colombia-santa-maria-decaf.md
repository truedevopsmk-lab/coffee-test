### Extra Context
This decaffeinated coffee is a community lot from Santa Maria in Colombia’s Huila region, an area widely recognized for high-altitude production and balanced sweetness. The coffee is decaffeinated using the **sugar cane (EA) process**, a method commonly used in Colombia that relies on naturally derived ethyl acetate from sugar cane to remove caffeine while preserving body and sweetness.

Coffee & Coconuts roasts its own coffee at its IJmuiden roastery, with a focus on approachability, consistency, and versatility across brew methods. Within the specialty community, Colombian sugar cane decafs are generally appreciated for their **round mouthfeel, gentle sweetness, and low bitterness**, making them well suited for both filter brewing and espresso-based drinks.
