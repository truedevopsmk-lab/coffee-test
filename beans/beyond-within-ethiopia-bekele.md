### Extra Context
Beyond Within Coffee Roasters, established in Budapest (est. 2014), focuses on small-batch roasting. This coffee is labeled as a natural-processed lot from Sidama, Ethiopia — a region widely recognized as one of the birthplaces of Arabica coffee and known for expressive, aromatic profiles. Natural Ethiopian coffees from Sidama are typically appreciated for their tea-like structure, layered florals, and fruit-forward character. The tasting notes listed on the bag suggest a balance between delicate tea-like qualities and developed sweetness.
