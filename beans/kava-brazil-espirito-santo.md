### Extra Context

Espírito Santo is an emerging specialty region in Brazil, increasingly recognized for higher-quality microlots beyond Brazil’s traditional commodity reputation. Competition lots from this region are typically selected for **clarity, sweetness, and balance**, rather than extreme acidity.

Community impressions of similar Brazilian competition lots emphasize **dessert-like sweetness, creamy mouthfeel, and low perceived acidity**, making them highly approachable for both filter and immersion brewing. This coffee is often described as comforting, smooth, and forgiving — ideal for daily brews with minimal dial-in stress.
