### Extra Context
This coffee is MAME Coffee’s sole decaffeinated offering, selected to demonstrate a clean and balanced decaf profile without relying on aggressive roast development. The coffee originates from Brazil’s Santos region and is processed using the Swiss Water decaffeination method, which removes caffeine without chemical solvents and is generally favored for preserving sweetness and mouthfeel.

Within the specialty community, Brazilian Swiss Water decafs are typically appreciated for their smooth texture, low bitterness, and confectionery sweetness rather than pronounced acidity. Coffees of this style are commonly described as approachable and versatile, performing well both as straight espresso and in milk-based drinks, including plant-based milk.
