### Extra Context

Gesha is one of the most celebrated coffee varieties globally, prized for its intense aromatics, floral complexity, and refined acidity. In Colombia’s high-altitude Nariño region, Gesha lots tend to express **vivid clarity with structured acidity and tea-like body**.

This coffee uses a **Washed Carbonic Maceration** process — a controlled fermentation technique adapted from winemaking that enhances aromatic intensity while preserving cleanliness. Community conversations around similar Gesha CM lots often mention **jasmine-like florals, tropical fruit esters, and elegant brightness** without overwhelming funk.

Subtext is widely respected for ultra-clean, acidity-forward roasting, making this coffee especially suited for slow, low-agitation pour-over brews where aromatics can fully bloom.
